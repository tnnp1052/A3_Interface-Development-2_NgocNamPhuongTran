        <p>Nice to meet you ╰(*´︶`*)╯♡</p>
        <p class="mb-0">My name is 永那 (Nana).</p>
        <p class="mb-0"><span class="fw-bold">永</span> is forever and ever.</p>
        <p><span class="fw-bold">那</span> is beautiful.</p>

        <p>I was born and raised in the lovely city Kyoto, Japan. Currently I’m attending Tokyo University of the Arts, majoring in Aesthetics and Art History.</p>

        <p>I love to try new things as my interests are all over the place. Everyday is a new challenge and opportunity to experience and get to learn more about the world.</p>

        <p>This blog is my attempt to share my new life with you in Tokyo and together we can enjoy small but memorable moments I come across.</p>
